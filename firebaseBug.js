The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email/password combination is incorrect, or if the user is already signed in with a different credential.  This can happen when the application doesn't handle these scenarios gracefully.  Specifically, the `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not be triggered correctly, making it difficult to determine the actual login status.
